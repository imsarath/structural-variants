# Structural Variants

Structural variation (also genomic structural variation) is the variation in structure of an organism's chromosome. It consists of 
many kinds of variation in the genome of one species, and usually includes microscopic and submicroscopic types, such as deletions,
duplications, copy-number variants, insertions, inversions and translocations.  Typically a structure variation affects a sequence length about 1Kb to 3Mb.
